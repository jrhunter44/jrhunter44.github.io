Every week, Cosmo & the Dunk Team traveled to elementary schools to deliver a special "Cougar Strong" assembly. 

My assignment to speak French was aimed at helping refugees from Haiti and West-African countries.



I've developed a strong background full of design, integration, and testing 
of mechatronic systems. Through company internships, academic research, and class projects, 
I've gained experience owning product designs from concept to real-world application.  




I create physics-based models, run simulations, build rapid prototypes, conduct tests, 
analyze failures, and iterate to bring engineering solutions to human problems - and its fun! 

I have a deep understanding of mechanical design and am proficient in CAD and programming, 
with personal familiarty with various manufacturing methods including machining, sheet metal stamping, 
and 3D printing. I enjoy working alongside other engineers and learning from their expertise. 







From leading design reviews and conducting in-depth analyses to managing vendor relations and 
executing tests, I have been involved in every aspect of the design process. I build prototypes, 
create models, analyze failures, and iterate to improve a design.

With over five years of experience in mechanical engineering, I specialize in integrating 
electrical and mechanical subsystems into unmanned air vehicles. I have a deep understanding 
of mechanical design and am proficient in CAD, with knowledge of various manufacturing methods 
such as machining, sheet metal fabrication, composites, and 3D printing. Supporting critical 
hardware demonstrations and traveling to test sites as needed, I am committed to delivering 
high-performance solutions in both laboratory and field environments.
